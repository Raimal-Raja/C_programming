## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and run these exercises, you will need:

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- A command-line interface (CLI) or integrated development environment (IDE) that supports C programming

### Compilation and Execution

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Raimal-Raja/C_programming.git
   cd C_programming
   ```


2. **Compile the desired exercise:**

   ```bash
   gcc -o output_filename Q_No_X.c
   ```


   Replace `output_filename` with your preferred name for the compiled program and `Q_No_X.c` with the name of the exercise file you wish to compile.

3. **Run the compiled program:**

   ```bash
   ./output_filename
   ```


## Exercise Details

Detailed descriptions and problem statements for each exercise are provided within the respective source files as comments. Reviewing these comments before examining the code will offer insights into the objectives and requirements of each exercise.
